CHANGELOG
=========

There is no real changelog, but you can look at the following things:

* The release changelog, which should contain most user-visible changes,
  including new features and bug fixes:

  https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/releases
* The git log, which is the "real" changelog
* The files ``client-api-changes.rst`` and ``interface-changes.rst`` in the
  ``DOCS`` sub directoryon the git repository, which document API and user
  interface changes (the latter usually documents breaking changes only, rather
  than additions).
* The file ``mplayer-changes.rst`` in the ``DOCS`` sub directory on the git
  repository, which used to be in place of this section. It documents some
  changes that happened since mplayer2 forked off MPlayer. (Not updated
  anymore.)
