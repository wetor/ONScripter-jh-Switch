Ideally, you shouldn't need enter any text here, and your commit messages should
explain your changes sufficiently (especially why they are needed). Read
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/contribute.md for coding
style and development conventions. Remove this text block, but if you haven't
agreed to it before, leave the following sentence in place:

I agree that my changes can be relicensed to LGPL 2.1 or later.
